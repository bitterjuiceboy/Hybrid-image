# Hybrid-image

This repository implements hybrid image generation in MATLAB.

## Introduction

Hybrid images combine the low-frequency (blurry) part of one image with the high-frequency (detailed) part of another. When viewed up close, you see one image; from afar, you see another. This technique is useful for visual illusions and image processing demonstrations.

## Features

- Read and align two input images
- Apply low-pass and high-pass filters
- Combine images to create a hybrid effect
- Visualize results at multiple scales

## Requirements

- MATLAB (R2018a or newer recommended)
- Image Processing Toolbox
